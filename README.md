# SpringsValley
My first video game.

SpringsValley Build01 can be found in the Builds folder.
Controls:
* WASD to move
* Esc for pause menu
* 1 for sword (click to swing), 2 for bow (when attackig needs to be held down)
* left click for normal attack
* right click for special attack

## Next Steps
### Fixes
* Skeletons get stuck on object, its worse in the build then the scene.
  * Could be a simple fix, just increase the allowable area around the objects.
  * They also might be getting stuck on each other? Could be it.
* Skeletons not attacking the player? its wonky in the scene but works don't know why it doesn't in the build.
* When restarting the level you need to hit Esc again to unpause the game, easy fix just one line of code.
* Bow animation.

### Admin
* Tidy up and comment files that need it.
* Delete unneeded files.
* reorder the folders, might be a cunt messing up the pathways but at some point needs to be done.

### New Features
* Make the skeletons attack better. Make them build up and swing, kinda like a dash.
* Add sprites to skeleton going verticle.
* Make the UI a little nicer instead of just being bare bones.
* Add sounds, taking damage, attacking and changing weapons.
* Make attacking animation better and having the weapon sit on the player nicer.
